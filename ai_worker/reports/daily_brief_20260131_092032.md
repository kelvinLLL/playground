*   **Interpretability & Safety:** Google DeepMind released **Gemma Scope 2**, offering open interpretability tools across the entire Gemma 3 family to help researchers understand complex model behaviors. [Source: DeepMind Blog]
*   **Privacy Red Alert:** A security leak at **Bondu** (AI toy company) exposed 50,000 chat logs between children and toys to anyone with a Gmail account, highlighting the risks of "always-on" AI companions. [Source: Wired]
*   **DeepSeek-OCR 2:** DeepSeek AI released a new version of its OCR system featuring a "Causal Visual Flow Encoder," designed to read complex document layouts more like a human. [Source: MarkTechPost]

## 📊 GitHub Trending
1.  **MoonshotAI/kimi-cli** (+377 stars): A powerful CLI tool for interacting with the Kimi LLM, reflecting the trend of moving AI workflows into the terminal.
2.  **modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps** (+195 stars): Tools for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a rising standard for connecting LLMs to external data and applications.
3.  **Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps** (+365 stars): A curated list of production-ready LLM applications, focusing heavily on RAG and agentic workflows.
4.  **NevaMind-AI/memU** (+465 stars): A personal memory assistant project designed to give LLMs long-term context about user interactions.
5.  **microsoft/playwright-cli** (+207 stars): Surge in interest likely linked to the rise of web-browsing agents (like Google's Auto Browse) that use Playwright for navigation.

## 🤗 HuggingFace Trending
*   **NVIDIA Cosmos Policy:** A new model for advanced robot control, providing a bridge between high-level reasoning and low-level physical actions.
*   **Daggr:** An innovative tool for chaining AI applications programmatically while providing a visual inspection interface for debugging agent "thoughts."
*   **AI2 SERA-32B:** The Allen Institute for AI's new open-weights coding agent that matches proprietary models using only supervised training and synthetic trajectories.
*   **AssetOpsBench:** A new benchmark from IBM Research designed to evaluate AI agents in industrial and "Asset Operations" environments rather than just software tasks.

## 💡 Investment Insights
*   **Specialized Inference is the New Alpha:** Microsoft’s **Maia 200** and the focus on FP4/FP8 precision suggest that the next phase of cloud competition isn't just about GPU count, but about custom silicon designed to make LLM inference economically viable at scale.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure 2.0:** **Railway’s** $100M Series B indicates a massive investor appetite for "AI-native" clouds that simplify the deployment of agentic workflows, moving away from the complexity of legacy AWS/Azure setups.
*   **The "Agent" Premium:** Startups focusing on *action* (agents) rather than *chat* (chatbots) are commanding the highest valuations and fastest development cycles (e.g., Anthropic’s Cowork, Listen Labs).

## 📝 Editor's Notes
Today’s data confirms we have entered the **"Action Phase"** of the AI cycle. The transition from LLMs as "answer engines" to "execution engines" is happening simultaneously across three fronts:
1.  **Coding:** Agents are now writing their own features (Anthropic using Claude Code to build Cowork).
2.  **Web Navigation:** Google’s Auto Browse and the surge in Playwright interest suggest the browser is the next major OS for AI.
3.  **Physical World:** The release of VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models like LingBot and Cosmos Policy shows that the same transformer architectures are successfully migrating from text to robotics.

**Actionable Trend:** Keep a close eye on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. As agents become more common, the "glue" that allows them to talk to different databases and apps (like the `ext-apps` trending on GitHub) will become the most critical part of the stack.
