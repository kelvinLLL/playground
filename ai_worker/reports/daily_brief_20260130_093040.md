## 💡 Investment Insights
*   **Cloud Infrastructure Disruption:** Railway's $100M raise despite $0 marketing spend suggests that developers are actively seeking alternatives to AWS/Azure that are built specifically for agentic workflows.
*   **Energy is the Bottleneck:** AI data centers are driving a massive **natural gas boom** and a pivot toward **next-gen nuclear** (SMRs). Investors should look at the intersection of AI compute and energy infrastructure.
*   **Agentic "Free-to-Play":** The rapid release of free alternatives (Goose) to paid tools (Claude Code) suggests that the "moat" for agentic coding tools may be thinner than previously thought, favoring platforms with the best distribution and UX rather than just the best model.

## 📝 Editor's Notes
Today's data highlights a critical shift: **We have moved past the "Chatbot Era" into the "Agentic Era."** 

Whether it's Google Chrome driving itself, Anthropic's Cowork managing files, or the viral obsession with Moltbot, the industry's focus has shifted from *generating text* to *executing actions*. However, the "privacy-utility trade-off" is reaching a breaking point—exemplified by the Bondu AI toy leak (50,000 logs exposed). As agents gain more autonomy (and access to our files and terminals), security and "Constitutional AI" governance will likely become the next major market sub-sector.

**Proactive Recommendation:** Watch the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** developments on GitHub; it is becoming the "TCP/IP" for how these agents talk to our apps.
