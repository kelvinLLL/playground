---

## 💡 Investment Insights
*   **The "Agentic" Shift:** Market sentiment is moving away from raw "tokens per second" (TPS) toward "task completion efficiency." Investors should look for companies optimizing for reasoning density rather than just inference speed.
*   **Security as a Moat:** The discovery of wallet-draining injections in social feeds highlights a massive gap in the "Agentic Web." Startups focusing on AI-specific firewalls and prompt-injection sanitization are becoming increasingly critical.
*   **Open Source vs. IP:** Discussions in the startup community today emphasize the dilemma of open-sourcing. Founders are increasingly wary of "big bulls" (VC-backed incumbents) cloning open-source ideas, leading to a potential rise in "Source Available" or "Delayed Open Source" models.

---

## 📝 Editor's Notes
Today’s data reflects a significant "maturation" phase in the local LLM ecosystem. We are no longer just seeing "smaller versions of GPT-4," but highly specialized tools like **GLM-OCR** and **TensorSeal** that solve specific deployment and security pain points. 

The security incident on Moltbook is a "canary in the coal mine" for the agentic era. As we move from "chatbots" to "agents that act," the surface area for malicious prompt injection expands from "annoying text output" to "actual financial loss." Expect "Agent Security" to be the dominant theme of H1 2026.

   From April 2025 to January 2026, I worked through Frankel’s &quot;The Geometry of Physics&quot;. The goal wasn’t to “relearn physics”, but to rebuild a modern geometric toolbox and see which mature ideas from geometry and topology might still be underused in machine learning. The book develops a large amount of machinery—manifolds, differential forms, connections and curvature, Lie groups and algebras, bundles, gauge theory, variational principles, topology—and shows how these arise naturally ac...

   Note: I posted this on r/androiddev but thought the deployment side might interest this sub. One of the biggest pains in mobile ML deployment is that your trained model usually sits unencrypted in the APK. If you spent $50k fine-tuning a model, that's a liability. I open-sourced a tool called TensorSeal that handles the encryption/decryption pipeline for Android. It ensures the model is only decrypted in memory (RAM) right before inference, keeping the disk footprint encrypted. It uses the TFLit...

   i just realised token per second is not the only thing that matters in agentic coding. glm 4.7 flash is almlst 3x faster but it keeps thinking for way more than 3 times the total tokens it generates so yes at the end devstral small finishes the task slighter faster than glm 4.7 flash. while obiously being much much better at agentic coding. token efficiency of devstral small has to be discussed more often. its incredble. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/theghost3172 [link] &#32; [comments]

   I built a thing that lets you run multiple AI models in the same chat since I got tired of copy pasting, they can see each other's responses and argue. Figured I'd test it on myself. Set up a VC Skeptic and a Customer Advocate to evaluate my own product. Expected a debate. Got a double homicide. The VC said I built chat, but louder, the Advocate, you know the one literally designed to defend me, said he wouldnt even use it for free. They didn't even disagree on anything. Just took turns telling ...

**1. [Nobody tells you how emotionally repetitive building a startup is ( I will not promote)](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1qu59o3/nobody_tells_you_how_emotionally_repetitive/)**
   I expected long hours. I expected uncertainty. I expected stress. What I didn’t expect was the repetition. Same doubts, different week. Same problems, slightly new form. Same motivation spikes followed by quiet crashes. It’s not dramatic failure or big wins, it’s the grind of making decisions without clear feedback, over and over. Some days feel productive. Others feel pointless. Most sit somewhere in between. For founders who’ve been at this longer: Did the emotional cycle change over time, or ...

   TBH I’m a bit scared. I know I probably shouldn’t be, and I’ve heard it usually works the other way around, but I’m a first-time founder and this feels like a big step for me. Just double-checking based on real experience. I am scared of big bulls also VC backed start ups! They have money, not me! &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/Wrong-Material-7435 [link] &#32; [comments]

   Just went through a rough breakup with my technical co-founder after about a year of building together. We got to ~300 users and ~$4k revenue - I know, rookie numbers, but it was my first startup. The dynamic was tough. He's more experienced on the technical side and constantly questioned my effort as the business co-founder. After a while it just wore me down. Hard to stay motivated when you're getting criticized all the time, not seeing results, and feeling blocked at every turn. We've agreed ...

   So, story time. I recently reached out to a VC fund with my early-stage prototypes: The call went okay at first. Then things got weird: He admitted they only invest from Seed+, so no funding was possible Suggested I “fake retract” my formal application so &quot;their internal systems wouldn’t register a rejection&quot; Told me to send my pitch deck to his private email, promising to connect me with other investors / angels …which sounded really off.

   This is a half business half career advice question, and I hope it's okay for me to post here. I’m a CS grad/musician, and for the past few months, I've been building a web DAW with integrated video chat. There are other web DAW + video chat apps out there, but mine has a slightly different approach. I am treating the app as a startup. I've been working on it for mostly 14+ hours a day for months. I want to host the product on its own website, make premium features, etc. I'd absolutely love for ...

   I've never really felt this way before but I was at the gym earlier last week and all I could think about was my startup. It felt like I was wasting time there when there was still so much to do. I ended up leaving after an hour (which is fine I guess, but I normally go 3x/week for ~1.5hrs each). I know it's a bad mindset to have but I couldn't get over it, and ended up being at the gym only once last week. The thing is I'm a big believer in work/life balance, and how downtime actually improves ...

**5. [特斯拉，可能得看SpaceX的脸色了？](http://www.huxiu.com/article/4831342.html?f=wangzhan)**
   作者｜Eastland头图｜视觉中国许多人相信2026年将是SpaceX的上市之年，承销商、募集金额、目标估值、IPO日期都传得有鼻子有眼。据外媒报道，当地时间2月2日，埃隆·马斯克旗下的太空探索技术公司（SpaceX）宣布收购人工智能初创公司xAI，合并后的公司估值将达到1.25万亿美元。这一收购或与特斯拉的困局紧密关联，回顾2025年11月，特斯拉股东大会批准了“薪酬激励方案”。但根据刚刚发布的《2025年报》，特斯拉现有业务（汽车、FSD、机器人）无法撑起1.5万亿美元市值。假如特斯拉因业绩欠佳、股价崩盘，“万亿美元薪酬”泡汤。就算SpaceX成功上市，也无法弥补马斯克的损失。而在并入收购了xAI的SpaceX之后，特斯拉市值将超越2万亿美元，马斯克将解锁3531万股特斯拉股票，其价值约合1万亿人民币。总之，千方百计提高特斯拉市值最符合马斯克的利益，让更“肥”的SpaceX“嫁”给特斯拉，是马斯克“大一统”梦想的一环。销量下行难逆转特斯拉交付量从快速增长到失速：2018年，交付24.6万辆、同比增长138%；2019年-2023年，增速持续回落，但保持在两位数；2024年．交付1...

   arXiv:2602.00059v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Optimizing discrete executable text such as prompts and code has recently been framed as a gradient-based process, effectively translating backpropagation concepts to the semantic space. However, existing methods predominantly operate as first-order optimizers akin to Stochastic Gradient Descent, which are suffering from slow convergence and instability because they neglect the semantic curvature of the optimization landscape. To bridge this gap, w...
