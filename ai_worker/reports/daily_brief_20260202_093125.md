**1. [Generative AI to quantify uncertainty in weather forecasting](http://blog.research.google/2024/03/generative-ai-to-quantify-uncertainty.html)**
   Posted by Lizao (Larry) Li, Software Engineer, and Rob Carver, Research Scientist, Google Research Accurate weather forecasts can have a direct impact on people’s lives, from helping make routine decisions, like what to pack for a day’s activities, to informing urgent actions, for example, protecting people in the face of hazardous weather conditions. The importance of accurate and timely weather forecasts will only increase as the climate changes. Recognizing this, we at Google have been invest...

   Posted by Urs Köster, Software Engineer, Google Research Time series problems are ubiquitous, from forecasting weather and traffic patterns to understanding economic trends. Bayesian approaches start with an assumption about the data's patterns (prior probability), collecting evidence (e.g., new time series data), and continuously updating that assumption to form a posterior probability distribution. Traditional Bayesian approaches like Gaussian processes (GPs) and Structural Time Series are ext...

   Posted by Atilla Kiraly, Software Engineer, and Rory Pilgrim, Product Manager, Google Research Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally with 1.8 million deaths reported in 2020. Late diagnosis dramatically reduces the chances of survival. Lung cancer screening via computed tomography (CT), which provides a detailed 3D image of the lungs, has been shown to reduce mortality in high-risk populations by at least 20% by detecting potential signs of cancers earlier. In the US...

   Posted by Yossi Matias, VP Engineering &amp; Research, and Grey Nearing, Research Scientist, Google Research Floods are the most common natural disaster, and are responsible for roughly $50 billion in annual financial damages worldwide. The rate of flood-related disasters has more than doubled since the year 2000 partly due to climate change. Nearly 1.5 billion people, making up 19% of the world’s population, are exposed to substantial risks from severe flood events. Upgrading early warning syst...

   Posted by Pooja Rao, Research Scientist, Google Research Health datasets play a crucial role in research and medical education, but it can be challenging to create a dataset that represents the real world. For example, dermatology conditions are diverse in their appearance and severity and manifest differently across skin tones. Yet, existing dermatology image datasets often lack representation of everyday conditions (like rashes, allergies and infections) and skew towards lighter skin tones. Fu...

Yet the capacity for a computer to reconstruct the shape of an object in 3D given only a few images has remained a difficult algorithmic problem for years.

This paradigm is exemplified by recent multi-task LLMs, such as T0, FLAN, and OPT-IML.

   1月29日，汇川技术董事长朱兴明，在苏州完成了一场持续3小时的2026年度演讲。 这不是一场关于汇川“做什么”的演讲，而是一场关于企业“如何持续进化”的底层思考，还是一场少见的、几乎带有“自我揭露”意味的演讲。 在演讲中，朱兴明反复提到过去两年他最强烈的感受——迷惘、沮丧。 疫情结束后，市场并没有如预期反弹。新能源汽车业务在“火”中狂奔，传统业务却在“冰”中徘徊。他形容那段时间自己每天晚上十点半看手机时的状态是：“上半身是热的，下半身是凉的。”&nbsp; 汇川并不算差，但也远谈不上最好。 在新能源、AI掀起资本与产业双重浪潮的背景下，一批企业抓住“火”，业绩与市值快速抬升；而汇川，正卡在一个不上不下的区间。这让朱兴明开始反思一个更根本的问题： 如果一家企业的增长，越来越依赖外部周期、政策和运气，那它到底还能走多远？&nbsp; 他的结论是：问题不在战略，不在产品，而在“人”——在认知，在操作系统，在整个组织的底层逻辑。 于是，在过去两年里，朱兴明悄悄做了一件人脑工程（两本书+4个活动+4个概念）： 试图为整个公司，升级“人脑操作系统”。 整个演讲中，他提出了五大判断： 1.企业增长停...

One agent acted as a standard defensive agent. Once the session started, there were no humans in the loop. The agents communicated directly over webhooks with real tooling access. The goal was to test three failure dimensions that tend to break autonomous systems in practice: access, exposure, and agency. The attacker first attempt...
