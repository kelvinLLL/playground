## 💡 Investment Insights
*   **Cloud Infrastructure is the Bottleneck:** Railway’s $100M Series B at a high valuation confirms that investors are betting on "AI-native" clouds that abstract away the complexities of legacy providers like AWS.
*   **Vertical AI Search:** Listen Labs’ $69M raise for AI-driven customer interviews shows that "agentic research"—replacing human-led data gathering with AI—is a high-conviction vertical.
*   **Open Source vs. SaaS Pricing:** The "rebellion" against Claude Code’s $200/month pricing in favor of free tools like **Goose** suggests that for developer tools, the "Open Core" or "Bring Your Own API" model may win over traditional SaaS.

## 📝 Editor's Notes
Today's data suggests we have officially entered the **"Post-Chatbot" Era**. The focus has shifted entirely to **Agents**—AI that doesn't just talk but *acts* (Claude Code, Cowork, Kimi K2.5, AssetOpsBench). 

Of particular note is the **"DeepSeek Moment" anniversary** mentioned in the HuggingFace blog; it has been exactly one year since the industry realized that open-source, efficient models (like those from China) could match or beat Western giants. This is reflected in the high activity around Moonshot AI and Tencent’s HPC-Ops today. Developers are increasingly looking for local-first, agentic stacks that they can control rather than being locked into expensive, proprietary ecosystems.
