## 🤖 AI/Tech News

### 💻 Coding & Development Agents
*   **Goose vs. Claude Code:** While Claude Code costs up to $200/month, Block (formerly Square) has gained traction with **Goose**, a free, open-source alternative for autonomous coding. 
*   **SERA by AI2:** The Allen Institute for AI released **SERA-32B**, a coding agent built using only supervised training and synthetic trajectories, aiming to match proprietary systems in repository-level automation.
*   **NousCoder-14B:** Nous Research released a new 14B model that matches larger proprietary systems in competitive programming, trained in just four days on Nvidia B200s.

### 🤖 Embodied AI & Robotics
*   **LingBot-VLA:** Ant Group's Robbyant unit released a Vision-Language-Action foundation model trained on 20,000 hours of bimanual teleoperation data for real-world robot control.
*   **NVIDIA Cosmos Policy:** A new model for advanced robot control was introduced on HuggingFace, signaling NVIDIA’s deepening move into the physical AI space.

### 🛡️ Security & Privacy
*   **AI Toy Leak:** The AI toy company **Bondu** exposed 50,000 logs of children's private conversations due to an unprotected web console.
*   **Deepfake Marketplaces:** A Stanford/Indiana study revealed that **Civitai** is hosting custom instruction files specifically designed to bypass filters and generate non-consensual celebrity deepfakes.

## 💡 Investment Insights
*   **Robotics is the New Frontier:** The $200M round for **LimX Dynamics** and the $100M+ raised by **Depth-AI** (AI Pharma) in two months signal that investors are moving past general LLMs toward "Embodied" and "Vertical" AI.
*   **The "Kimi" Global Expansion:** Moonshot AI’s **Kimi** (K2.5) now generates more revenue overseas than domestically, suggesting that Chinese AI labs are successfully competing on the global stage via OpenRouter and API access.
*   **Energy Constraints:** Data centers are driving a 25x increase in US gas projects. Investment in **next-gen nuclear** and **deep cryogenic technology** (e.g., **中科清能's** $70M+ round) are becoming critical "picks and shovels" plays for the AI era.

## 📝 Editor's Notes
Today’s data reflects a **"Post-Chatbot" era**. We are no longer just talking to LLMs; we are letting them control our terminals (Claude Code), our browsers (Auto Browse), and our robots (LingBot). 

The most interesting trend is the **"Agentic Rebellion."** As Anthropic and OpenAI move toward high-cost, high-control agents, the open-source community is responding with extreme speed. The fact that Goose and SERA were released almost immediately after Claude Code indicates that the "moat" for agentic workflows may be thinner than the models themselves. Developers should watch the **"Generative UI"** space—the shift from text boxes to agents that manipulate live interface elements (tables, charts, forms) is the next major UX transition.
