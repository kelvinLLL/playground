# Skill: Deep Reading (Lite)
Description: Systematic analysis framework for deep understanding of papers, articles, and reports.

## When to use
Use this skill when the user asks to:
- "Analyze this paper/article"
- "Summarize this long text"
- "Extract insights from this report"
- "Critique this argument"

## Workflow

### 1. Goal Setting
Ask the user (if not clear):
- **Purpose**: Problem-solving, Learning, or Decision-making?
- **Depth**: Quick scan (15m) or Deep dive (1h)?

### 2. Analysis Frameworks

#### A. SCQA (Structure)
- **S (Situation)**: What is the background context?
- **C (Complication)**: What is the core problem or conflict?
- **Q (Question)**: What is the central question being addressed?
- **A (Answer)**: What is the proposed solution or thesis?

#### B. Critical Thinking (Evaluation)
- **Strengths**: What arguments are well-supported?
- **Weaknesses**: Where is evidence lacking? logic flawed?
- **Bias Check**: Are there hidden assumptions?

#### C. First Principles (Essence)
- Strip away analogies and assumptions.
- What are the fundamental truths remaining?

### 3. Synthesis Output

Generate a report structured as:

1.  **Executive Summary** (SCQA format)
2.  **Key Insights** (Top 3 takeaways)
3.  **Critical Analysis** (Strengths/Weaknesses)
4.  **Actionable Plan** (If applicable: Next steps)

## Usage Example
"I will apply the Deep Reading framework. First, let's establish the SCQA structure..."
